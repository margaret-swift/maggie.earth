## READ ME

Welcome! I'm Maggie Swift, an Atkinson Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell K. Lisa Yang Center for Wildlife Health in Ithaca, NY. My research interests include animal movements, savanna ecology, One Health, and computational approaches to wildlife management and conservation.

In my postdoctoral research with Dr. Steve Osofsky at Cornell's AHEAD program and Dr. Robin Naidoo at the WWF, I combine remote sensing and computer simulation to model African bush elephant movements in the Kavango-Zambezi TFCA. Check out my recorded talks on wildlife conservation for more of my past work.

Outside work, I write short fiction and data science tutorials; knit; play guitar; travel with friends; and update my blog. As a resident of lands stolen from the Gayogohó:nǫˀ Nation by New York State, I also strive to decolonize my science. I am happiest snapping photos in the African bush or waist-deep in Cascadilla Creek, stalking my subjects like a heron.
